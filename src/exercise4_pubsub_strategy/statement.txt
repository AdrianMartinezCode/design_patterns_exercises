You are tasked with designing a weather monitoring system that receives weather data from different weather
stations, processes it, and notifies subscribed clients about weather updates in their area. The system should
also allow clients to request custom weather updates, like hourly forecasts or severe weather alerts.

Design a solution that allows the weather monitoring system to receive and process data from multiple weather
stations with different data formats, notify clients about weather updates, and enable clients to request custom
weather updates. Your solution should be flexible enough to add new weather stations and custom weather update types
without modifying the existing code.

Write the code in your preferred programming language without mentioning the design patterns used.
