Exercise 2:
Imagine you are working on a document editor application, which allows users to create different types of
shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles. The application should be easily extensible to support
new shapes in the future without modifying the existing code. Write a solution that allows drawing and
resizing these shapes, and I'll review it for you.
