You are developing a cross-platform UI library that allows developers to create user
interfaces for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux). The library needs to
support creating buttons, checkboxes, and text fields that are visually consistent within each
operating system.

Design an Abstract Factory pattern that allows the application to create UI elements specific to each operating
system without modifying the existing code when adding support for a new operating system. Your solution
should include an abstract factory class or interface, concrete factory classes for each operating system,
and appropriate UI element classes. Write the code in your preferred programming language.
